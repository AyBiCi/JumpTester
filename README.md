# JumpTester
Bukkit plugin for testing jumps on parkour servers, while building them.

# How to use it
To start testing, come to the place when you want to start a jump and type command /settestloc. Now you should have a test item, that you will use when you want to go back to the start position. If you lost this item somehow, you can type /testitem to get another one. To turn off tester, use command /stoptesting. To change spawn place, just move to the another position and type again /settestloc.
